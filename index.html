        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>
           She is mad educated. Graduated top of her class in creche, then moved on to rock the rankings in primary school, 
           before finally losing herself in high school where she gave up. 
           But don't let that fool you, she still got 4 distinctions in matric. 
           The girl then went on to study some things she hated (ew science) in university, but shame, she couldn't get a job and now she's here.
           Life so tough fr.

        <h4>Experience</h4>
        <p>
            V minimal work experience. She doesn't really like working, but let's all be honest, who does? The real work experience is the friends
            we made along the way. Okay but on a real, she worked at Spur for a tydjie, then so last year she worked down the road by Islamic Relief
            for a few terrible months. Hopefully this course works out for her, because we're all a bit worried.

        <h4>Skills</h4>
        <p>
            Literally has no skills or talents. Just move on, so sorry. Lol jokes, I guess she can cook and bake and clean (honestly could be a
            really amazing housewife if there are any rich men reading this, age is not a problem unless you're a minor.) Other than that, she can be
            good at like researching and stuff, and idk she's pretty handy when you need her to be ;)
